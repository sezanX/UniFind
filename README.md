## Problem Statement

Losing personal belongings on a large university campus is a common and stressful experience. Without a centralized system, the process of recovering lost items is often disorganized, relying on chance or scattered physical lost-and-found boxes. This leads to a low recovery rate and significant inconvenience for the campus community. UniFind aims to solve this problem by providing a single, reliable online platform to streamline the entire process of reporting, searching for, and returning lost and found items.

## Key Features

UniFind is divided into two main components: a public-facing user portal and a comprehensive admin panel.

### User Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system (`signup.php`, `login.php`).
-   **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their personal information and change their password (`profile.php`).
-   **Report Lost Items**: A detailed form allows users to report items they have lost, including title, description, category, location, date of loss, and an optional image upload (`report_lost.php`).
-   **Report Found Items**: A similar form for users to report items they have found, helping to reunite them with their owners (`report_found.php`).
-   **Advanced Search**: A powerful search page with filters for item type (lost/found), category, department, date range, and keywords to easily browse all reported items (`search.php`).
-   **Intelligent Matching System**: When a user reports a lost item, the system automatically suggests potential matches from the found items database based on category, date, and location similarity (`report_lost.php`, `lost_item.php`).
-   **My Reports Dashboard**: A personal dashboard where users can view the status of all items they have reported (lost, found, and matched) and perform actions like editing or deleting their reports (`my_reports.php`).
-   **Secure Contact**: Logged-in users can view contact information for item reporters to arrange a return. A messaging system allows users to communicate securely about an item (`contact_finder.php`).

### Admin Features

-   **Admin Dashboard**: A central dashboard providing a statistical overview of the system, including total users, lost items, found items, and matches (`admin/dashboard.php`).
-   **User Management**: Admins have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities over all user accounts. They can view user details, edit profiles, and grant or revoke admin privileges (`admin/manage_users.php`).
-   **Item Management**: Complete control over all lost and found item reports. Admins can edit details, update the status of an item (e.g., from 'active' to 'returned'), and delete reports (`admin/manage_items.php`).
-   **Match Management**: Admins can review, approve, or reject matches initiated by users, ensuring the integrity of the return process (`admin/manage_matches.php`, `admin/review_match.php`).
-   **Category & Department Management**: Admins can manage the lists of item categories and university departments available in forms and filters (`admin/manage_categories.php`, `admin/manage_departments.php`).

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: **PHP**
-   **Database**: **MySQL**
-   **Frontend**: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery**
-   **Framework/Libraries**: **Bootstrap 5** for responsive UI components.

## System Architecture

UniFind is built on a classic client-server model with a modular PHP backend.

-   **Core Logic (`/includes`)**:
    -   `db.php`: Manages the MySQL database connection.
    -   `auth.php`: Handles all user authentication logic, including registration, login, sessions, and role-based access control.
    -   `functions.php`: A central file containing reusable functions for core application logic like image uploads, data fetching, searching, and automatic matching.
-   **User Interface**: The root directory contains the user-facing pages. Each page includes a common header and footer (`includes/header.php`, `includes/footer.php`) for a consistent layout.
-   **Admin Panel (`/admin`)**: A separate, secure directory for administrative functions. Access is restricted to users with an 'admin' role via checks in `admin/includes/admin_header.php`.

## Database Schema

The MySQL database (`unifind_db.sql`) consists of several related tables to store all application data:

-   `users`: Stores user account information, including credentials and role (user/admin).
-   `departments`: A list of university departments.
-   `categories`: A list of item categories (e.g., Electronics, Books, ID Cards).
-   `lost_items`: Contains all details for items reported as lost.
-   `found_items`: Contains all details for items reported as found.
-   `matches`: Links a `lost_items` record with a `found_items` record, managed by admins.
-   `contact_messages`: Stores messages sent between users regarding an item.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run this project on a local server, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    -   A local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or WAMP.
    -   A web browser.
    -   A database management tool like phpMyAdmin (included with XAMPP).

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/UniFind.git](https://github.com/your-username/UniFind.git)
    ```
    Move the cloned project folder into your server's web directory (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/`).

3.  **Database Setup**:
    -   Start the Apache and MySQL services from your XAMPP control panel.
    -   Open phpMyAdmin by navigating to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    -   Create a new database and name it `unifind_db`.
    -   Select the new database and go to the "Import" tab.
    -   Click "Choose File" and select the `unifind_db.sql` file from the project directory.
    -   Click "Go" to import the database schema and default data.

4.  **Database Configuration**:
    -   Open the file `includes/db.php`.
    -   Verify that the database credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_NAME`) match your local server setup. By default, they are set for a standard XAMPP installation.
    ```php
    define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USER', 'root');
    define('DB_PASS', ''); // Default is empty for XAMPP
    define('DB_NAME', 'unifind_db');
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**:
    -   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/UniFind/` (or the name you gave the project folder).

## Usage

-   **General User**: You can create a new account via the "Sign Up" page or browse publicly listed items.
-   **Admin Access**: The database import includes a default admin account.
    -   **Username**: `admin`
    -   **Password**: `admin123`
    -   Log in with these credentials to access the Admin Dashboard. **It is highly recommended to change the default password after your first login.**
